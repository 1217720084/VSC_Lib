# Grid Forming Models for Matlab/SimPowerSystem

## Introduction
After the european project [Migrate](https://www.h2020-migrate.eu), generic simulation models for grid forming converters has been developped.

The package in this repository are a set of Grid-Forming inverter models for Matlab/SimpowerSystem. It is intended as a simulation library for researchers, engineers, teachers or students that is easy to use or modify.

## Terms of use
The package is distributed as MIT license
While not required by the terms of the license, we do request that publications derived from the use of the models explicitly cite the following references:

Please see the LICENSE file for details

## Getting started
